\multicolumn{2}{|p{4.3in}|}{{\textcolor{jungle}{Removal of the word ``synagogues'' from the verse support an Amillennial or Post-Millennial reading, devoid of any Jewish presence. The is also fueled by an entirely historical interpretation of Psalm 74, where the destruction is taken to refer to the first Temple destruction. This word change is usually accompanied by an excision of the word ``congregations'' in verse 4, which speaks of people instead of a place. Commentators (such as Ryrie) claim that ``synagogues'' cannot be correct as these develop later in history, although the word choice is perfectly consistent with the Tribulation context of the rest of the psalm.}}} \\ \hline
