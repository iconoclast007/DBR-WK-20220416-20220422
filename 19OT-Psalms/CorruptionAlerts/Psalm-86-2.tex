\multicolumn{2}{|p{4.3in}|}{{\textcolor{jungle}{Modern translations, have trouble with the words ``soul'' and ``holy,'' usually choosing ``life'' and ``godly'' or ``faithful.''  The word ``life'' bypasses the truth about the triune nature of mankind and attempts to force New Testament salvation (by grace through the blood atonement) into Old Testament situations where the blood atonement was not available.  Changing the word ``holy'' sets aside the truths that Israel as a nation was commanded to be holy in Exodus 22:31 and Israel was ``holy'' in Exodus 19:6.  Or, as is done in Psalm 16:10, David could be speaking for the Lord Jesus Christ.}}} \\ \hline
