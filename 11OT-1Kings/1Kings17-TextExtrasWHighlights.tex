[2] \textcolor[cmyk]{0.99998,1,0,0}{And the word \fcolorbox{bone}{bone}{of the} LORD came unto him, saying,}
[3] \textcolor[cmyk]{0.99998,1,0,0}{Get thee hence, and turn thee eastward, and hide thyself by the brook Cherith, that \emph{is} before Jordan.}
[4] \textcolor[cmyk]{0.99998,1,0,0}{And it shall be, \emph{that} thou shalt drink \fcolorbox{bone}{bone}{of the} brook; and \fcolorbox{bone}{bone}{I} have commanded the ravens to feed thee there.}
[5] \textcolor[cmyk]{0.99998,1,0,0}{So he went and did according unto the word \fcolorbox{bone}{bone}{of the} LORD: for he went and dwelt by the brook Cherith, that \emph{is} before Jordan.}
[6] \textcolor[cmyk]{0.99998,1,0,0}{And the ravens brought him bread and flesh in the morning, and bread and flesh in the evening; and he drank \fcolorbox{bone}{bone}{of the} brook.}
[7] \textcolor[cmyk]{0.99998,1,0,0}{And it came to pass after a while, that the brook dried up, because there had been no rain in the land.}\\

[9] \textcolor[cmyk]{0.99998,1,0,0}{Arise, get thee to Zarephath, which \emph{belongeth} to Zidon, and dwell there: behold, \fcolorbox{bone}{bone}{I} have commanded a widow woman there to sustain thee.}
[10] \textcolor[cmyk]{0.99998,1,0,0}{So he arose and went to Zarephath. And when he came to the gate \fcolorbox{bone}{bone}{of the} city, behold, the widow woman \emph{was} there gathering of sticks: and he called to her, and said, Fetch me, \fcolorbox{bone}{bone}{I} pray thee, a little water in a vessel, that \fcolorbox{bone}{bone}{I} may drink.}
[11] \textcolor[cmyk]{0.99998,1,0,0}{And as she was going to fetch \emph{it}, he called to her, and said, Bring me, \fcolorbox{bone}{bone}{I} pray thee, a morsel of bread in thine hand.}

[18] \textcolor[cmyk]{0.99998,1,0,0}{And she said unto Elijah, What have \fcolorbox{bone}{bone}{I} to do with thee, O thou man of God? art thou come unto me to call my sin to remembrance, and to slay my son?}
