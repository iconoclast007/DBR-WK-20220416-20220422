\multicolumn{2}{|p{4.3in}|}{{\textcolor{jungle}{The word ``infirmity'' is changed to “anguish,” “grief,” and “misfortune.” It is removed completely in the ESV and NIV. The effect is destroying the connection to “sore” in verse 2. The psalmist here, who typifies the Tribulation Jew, has 2 infirmities: A physical one, and a spiritual one. The infirmity, or infirmities, are emphasized by the word ``my.'' Ruckman points out that and infirmity is a weakness as in 2 Corinthians 11:30 and 12:5.\cite{Ruckman1992PsalmsV2}.}}} \\ \hline
