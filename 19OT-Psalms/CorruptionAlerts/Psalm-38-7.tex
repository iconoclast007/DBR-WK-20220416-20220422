\multicolumn{2}{|p{4.2in}|}{{\textcolor{jungle}{Modern translations, remove the reference to ``loathsome disease'' in the verse. In the case of David, this loathsome disease could have been leprosy, or it could have been some sort of venereal disease, perhaps brought about through his escapade with Bathsheba. In the case of mankind, the loathsome disease, a terminal disease, is the sin nature.  The sin of mankind is taken upon by Jesus at the cross, hinting at by the concern over a forsaking in verse 22. In type, the Jews will have to recognize and detest their sin as a nation and cry out to the Lord. They will need to declare their iniquity as in verse 18.  Removal of the reference to loathing takes away the cross references in Job (Job 7:5 and 7:16), with Job, of course, who typifies the Jews in the Great Tribulation.}}} \\ \hline
