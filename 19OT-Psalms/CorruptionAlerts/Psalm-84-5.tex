\multicolumn{2}{|p{4.3in}|}{{\textcolor{jungle}{In the verse, the word ``them'' has to refer back in the verse to something else that is plural, most likely the ``tabernacles'' (which have been removed in modern versions). So, then, the ``ways of them'' are the ways of the tabernacles and of those who are serving inside the Temple.Those people are the people in verse 7 who go on, through trying circumstances, praising the Lord and relying on God for strength. The Christina can claim Romans 8:28, through all things, and turn tears into refreshing waters. The verse is not speaking of a physical pilgrimage but a spiritual transformation that has already taken place. \cite{Ruckman1992PsalmsV2}}}} \\ \hline
