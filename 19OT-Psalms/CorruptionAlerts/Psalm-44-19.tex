\multicolumn{2}{|p{4.3in}|}{{\textcolor{jungle}{Changing ``dragons' to ``jackal'' removes the connection to the ``great red dragon'' in Revelation 12:3, as well as all the cross references to ``dragon'' and ``dragons'' in scripture (35 uses in the AV). Further, truths about a creature known as Leviathan are also obscured (Job 41:1, Psalm 74:14, Psalm 104:26, and Isaiah 27:1 - note a total of FIVE references). Note that the very same word translated as ``dragon'' in the AV in Psalm 44:19 and NOT by modern versions, IS translated as ``dragon'' in modern versions in Isaiah 27:1.  Further, some of the modern versions replace ``shadow of death'' in the verse with ``deep darkness' (whatever ``deep darkness'' is.)}}} \\ \hline
