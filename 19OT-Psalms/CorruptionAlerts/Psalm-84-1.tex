\multicolumn{2}{|p{4.3in}|}{{\textcolor{jungle}{The word ``tabernacles'' refers to the the variety of God's dwelling places. There is the Tabernacles in the wilderness. There is the sanctuary under Solomon. There is the rebuilt Temple under Herod. In the Millennium, there will be a rebuilt Temple (see Ezekiel 40-46), complete with ``courts'' verse 10 with Ezekiel 40:19-20) and ``altars'' (verse 3 with Ezekiel 40:39-42, 41:22, ad 43:19-27. There is no need to change the word or to make the plural word ``tabernacles'' singular.  It is almost as if someone is trying to remove the literal, earthly Millennial Temple with God's presence.\cite{Ruckman1992Psalms}}}} \\ \hline
