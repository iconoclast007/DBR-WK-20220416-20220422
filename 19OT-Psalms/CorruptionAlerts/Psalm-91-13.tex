\multicolumn{2}{|p{4.3in}|}{{\textcolor{jungle}{{Modern translations, change this reference to ``the dragon'', removing the cross references to his idnetity and his destruction in Revelation 12:3-4, Isaiah 63:1-6, Psalm 68:21, and Habakkuk 3:13, among others. This instance demonstrates the inconsistency of modern transalators, as they render the same word as ``monster'' in Jeremiah 51, and as ``reptile'' in Isaiah 27:1.}}} \\ \hline
