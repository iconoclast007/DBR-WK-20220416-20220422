\multicolumn{2}{|p{4.3in}|}{{\textcolor{jungle}{Modern translations change the word ``houses'' to ``pastures'' or ``pasturelands.'' The change removes the cross reference in Psalm 74:8 (also removed in new translations) to ``synagogues.'' If the correct word was ``pastures'' or something similar, then Zeba and Zalmuuna, back in Judges 8, had an incredible estimation of these ``tents.'' No, ``houses'' is a future references, as Psalm 74:8, to the Tribulation, during which forces will remove all vestiges of Judaism from Israel, by destroying the ``houses of God.'' These forces will be the military arm of a one-world religion.}}} \\ \hline
